; Flyspell
; So much text writing... and I'm so bad at spelling...
; Opting for ispell since it seems easy to install and Flyspell uses it by default
; Don't forget to install it from the base package manager

; FINALLY
; So arcane...
; - Gemini was unaware of the ispell-local-dictionary-alist monstrosity that seems to need to be there
; - There is chatter on StackOverflow that the hunspell-dictionary-alist doesn't auto-populate correctly... so you need to write it from the ispell one
; - Then you need the extra paths as well for searching, since I couldn't change the command line version in the OS for some ungodly reason
; - Obviously this is only on Windows. I'm sure this'll be easier on nix.
